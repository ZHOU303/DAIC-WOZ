This project is a model for detecting depression.

1.Run the get_weight.py file under the text, audio, and visual folders.

2.Run the get_parameter.py file under the text, audio, and visual folders.

3.Run the Residual_fusion.py file to obtain the final model.

Note: I do not have permission to share the data; therefore, the original data is not provided.
However, the weight file and parameter file have already been trained in this project.
You can directly run the Residual_fusion.py file to get the final result.
